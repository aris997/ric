**`Remake In C`**

I am currently working on a remake of git, writing it in C.

because why not?

and also get back on algorithms and C as a low level language (been too much time coding in python)

## FAQ

1. _Do we need it?_ no.
2. _Will it works as a replacement of git?_ Probably not.
3. _Can I contribute to the project?_ YES! I need help and maybe a guide to learn how team working.
4. _Can I ask you a question?_ Of course here -> [rr@riccardoriva.dev](mailto:rr@riccardoriva.dev)
